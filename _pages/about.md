I am a PhD candidate at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, advised by Prof. Ang Wei Tech. My research focuses on developing a robot-assisted feeding system that personalizes actions, such as modifying bite size, based on user preferences and language corrections. I am also exploring the integration of foundation models into robotics for more adaptive and intelligent systems.

My research interests include human-robot interaction and machine learning. I am particularly interested in how robots can better understand human intent and behavior, and learn to act in ways that are intuitive and responsive to user needs. My goal is to develop robots that can offer personalized assistance and continually improve their assistance through experience through lifelong learning.

When I'm not working on robots, I enjoy creative pursuits like crocheting, knitting, and 3D printing. I'm drawn to aesthetic design and I believe in making things not just functional but also beautiful.
